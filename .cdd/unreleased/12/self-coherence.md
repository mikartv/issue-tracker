## §Gap

**Issue:** gh #2 — bug: raw enum values displayed in issue-detail (status, priority, Move to button)
**Mode:** design-and-build
**Version:** cycle/12

The gap is the absence of `statusLabels` and `priorityLabels` maps in `IssueDetailComponent`. The component renders `{{ issue.status }}`, `{{ issue.priority }}`, and `Move to {{ nextStatus }}` — all raw enum keys from the database (`in_progress`, `critical`). `ProjectIssuesComponent` already ships the correct label maps (since cycle 7); `IssueDetailComponent` regressed when it was added in cycle 8. This cycle closes the regression.
